# Udacity MLND Capstone

Capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree

## Project Overview

For this project, we have to detect which species of fish appears on a boat, based on images captured from boat cameras of various angles.
Our goal is to predict the likelihood of fish species in each picture from the given Eight categories: 1. Albacore tuna 2. Bigeye tuna 3. Yellowfin tuna 4. Mahi Mahi 5. Opah 6. Sharks 7. Others (meaning that there are fish present but not in the above categories) 8. No Fish (meaning no fish in the picture). 

Each image has only one fish category, expect that there are sometimes very small fish in the pictures that are used as bait.

## Project: Capstone Proposal and Capstone Project 

The Capstone is a two-staged project. The first is the proposal component, where you can receive valuable feedback about your project idea, design, and proposed solution. This must be completed prior to your implementation and submitting for the capstone project.

You can find the [capstone proposal rubric here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/410/view), and the [capstone project rubric here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/108/view). Please ensure that you are following directions correctly before submitting these two stages which encapsulate your capstone.

Please email [machine-support@udacity.com](mailto:machine-support@udacity.com) if you have any questions.

## Project Overview

For this project, we have to detect which species of fish appears on a boat, based on images captured from boat cameras of various angles.
Our goal is to predict the likelihood of fish species in each picture from the given Eight categories: Albacore tuna, Bigeye tuna, Yellowfin tuna, Mahi Mahi, Opah, Sharks, Others (meaning that there are fish present but not in the above categories), No Fish (meaning no fish in the picture). 

Each image has only one fish category, expect that there are sometimes very small fish in the pictures that are used as bait.
